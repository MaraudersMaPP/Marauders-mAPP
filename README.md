Potential2Grow-Edmonton is a webapp that allows local Edmonton residents to visualize and inform themselves of the potential for Urban farming in their community. Urban Farming, which is the process of cultivation, processing and distribution of locally grown food within an urban environment. Urban Agriculture in Canada has taken to form of a social movement to promote organic food production and sustainable cities. The movement is rooted in promoting commmunity holism and environmentally friendly development of vacant land. Additionally, the ability to provide local fresh food through urban farming can be associated with improvements in food security.
Edmonton as a city, frequently ranks among the highest in Canada for sutainable development acitivties and open data policies.For this reason. In 2012, the city approved the "Fresh" intiative to promote this cause. 
"Fresh" is a high level strategy that will help guide Edmonton towards the vision of “a resilient food and agriculture system that contributes to the local economy and the overall cultural, financial, social and environmental sustainability of the city.”
It is through the development of this Esri WebApp, that local Edmonton residents can see the potential benefits Urban Agriculture can provide their communities.

"Potential2Grow - Edmonton" is an app designed to supplement a user's interest in Urban Agriculture through an interactive web app. The app allows the user to identify their neighbourhood (or a neighbourhood of interest) through an interactive map. Once selected, a user is taken to an interactive map of their neighbourhood displaying all buildings and houses present. The user is then able to investigate the potential of an area in their neighbourhood as an Urban Garden by drawing out the layout of the garden. The app then provides the growing potentials for the area drawn including the quantity of produce that can be recovered from the area and the basic irrigattion requirements to sustain such production. The User may then recieve the option to investigate the potential of nearby buildings to act as rain-water collectors by clicking on building rooftops.
