#WebApp Characteristics
----
*Unique Functionality*

"Potential2Grow - Edmonton" is an app designed to supplement a user's interest in Urban Agriculture through an interactive web app. 
The app allows the user to identify their neighbourhood (or a neighbourhood of interest) through an interactive map. 
Once selected, a user is taken to an interactive map of their neighbourhood displaying all buildings and houses present. 
The user is then able to investigate the potential of an area in their neighbourhood as an Urban Garden by drawing out the layout 
of the garden. The app then provides the growing potentials for the area drawn including the quantity of produce that can be
recovered from the area and the basic irrigattion requirements to sustain such production. The User may then recieve the option 
to investigate the potential of nearby buildings to act as rain-water collectors by clicking on building rooftops.

*Location and Scope*

Edmonton as a city, frequently ranks among the highest in Canada for sutainable development acitivties and open data policies. 

For
this reason. In 2012, the city approved the "Fresh" intiative to promote this cause. 
"Fresh" is a high level strategy that will help guide Edmonton towards the vision of “a resilient food and agriculture system 
that contributes to the local economy and the overall cultural, financial, social and environmental sustainability of the city.”
It is through the development of this Esri WebApp, that local Edmonton residents can see the potential benefits Urban Agriculture
can provide their communities.
Edmonton's robust open data portal was utilized for this App. The portal, which consists of nearly 1000 datasets, is the largest in canada and provides a wealth of information for public usage.
