###Limitations & Known Issues
* The App is limited by the available imagery as provided in the Esri Imagery Basemap, where low resolution exists, the streets basemap acts as an alternative.
* When in Google Chrome or Opera Browsers, the double click to finish drawing feature is disfunctional. The finish measurement button must be used
* A selection of 10 common garden vegetables were selected and yield by area calculations, as well as water requirements are shown for only those secific vegetables. May not be representative of vegetables not included in the popup

###Assumptions
* All values are estimations made on current climate data. Rainwater collection values are based on interpolated rain data from local rain gauges ove the previous 6 year period.
* Building rooflines are only approximate representations of actual roofline and some innacuracy is inherently present
* Vegetable yields are calculated on an area and water requirement basis and optimal nutrient/fertilization fulfillments are assumed.
* Growing seasons are assummed to be May 1st - September 30th.

###Data Sources
Several Publically Available Datasets were utilized in the App's Construction

*Spatial Datasets: Used on License from the City of Edmonton Open Data Portal*
* Neighbourhoods - Shapefile for all 383 neighbourhoods in Edmonton
* Rooflines - Shapefile for all 327000 building rooflines in Edmonton
* Weather Gauge Data(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015) - 15 gauges spread across the city.
